  DeMail is a decentralized mail system that facilitates the sending and receiving of mail or messages through wallet addresses. In addition to the message content, senders have the ability to attach files, which are stored in IPFS using web3 storage. The system includes "sent" and "inbox" buttons, allowing users to view sent and received emails respectively. Alternatively, users can utilize Ethereum Name Service (ENS) in place of wallet addresses. Upon receipt, the recipient can be notified of the message through integration with the Push protocol. The entirety of the database is stored in TableLand decentralized SQL storage, while the frontend is deployed on Vercel.
